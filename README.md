# CitySights

CitySights App

This app will use CoreLocation to geo locate the user. Once it has permission to locate, it will
send location information off to the Yelp API and return local restaurants and sights to the
user. It will also provide the user with the Yelp rating, clickable contact info, a map view
of the locations, and directions to the venue when desired.

## Yelp API Key

If you wish to see this app in action, you will need to provide a valid Yelp API key in the
PrivateConstants.swift file. I am not tracking my personal key on GitHub since this is a
public repo.

## Asset Images

Images in this app do not belong to me. These were provided as a package of resources from
CWC+.
